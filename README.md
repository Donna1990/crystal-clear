# Milestone Project 1 - Crystal Clear

This project was created to house a place for crystal fans. It includes a Homepage which holds information regarding crystals and how to choose the correct crystal for you. It also holds a Crystal care page which explains different methods of looking after your crystals. The Crystal Gallery displays images of several popular crystals. I have also included a Newsletter Subscription page, under the title of Join Us!
